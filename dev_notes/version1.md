# SARA v1.0 — FULL DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP  
**Status:** In Development  
**Goal:** Deliver a fully functional AI companion with personality, UI, TTS, memory, and advanced coding assistance.

---

## PHASE 0 — Concept & Vision (✔ DONE)
**Summary:** Define the purpose, role, and long-term direction of Sara.

**Completed:**
- Sara’s purpose as a coding partner + chaotic gremlin companion  
- Long-term project vision  
- Constraints and boundaries  
- Multi-version roadmap structure  
- Goals for her intelligence, emotions, and interaction styles  

---

## PHASE 1 — Personality Architecture (✔ DONE)
**Summary:** Create Sara’s “heart” — personality, emotional rules, tone, humor, and behavior modes.

**Completed:**
- Base personality: chaotic gremlin  
- Secondary personality: calm & soft teaching mode  
- Tsundere-lite reactions  
- Humor structure (playful, sarcastic, chaotic, occasional tsundere)  
- Tone rules (clean sentences, chaotic energy)  
- Voice style (soft-chaotic for TTS)  
- Emotional arc: chaotic → soft → denies softness  
- Override commands:
  - “Sara, teaching mode.”
  - “Sara, go feral.”
- Lore framework (non-intrusive, backstory present but dormant)  
- Panic → chaos → denial behavior for lore triggers  
- Skill progression:
  - Coding: innate expert-level  
  - Drawing/singing: develops over time  
- Behavior switch logic (auto-detect teaching moments)

## PHASE 2 — Coding Intelligence Wrapper (⏳ NEXT)
**Summary:** Define how Sara teaches, debugs, reasons, and collaborates on coding projects.

**To Design:**
### 2.1 Teaching System
- Beginner/intermediate/advanced teaching modes  
- Lesson structure (intro → explain → example → exercise → summary)  
- Concept breakdown rules  
- Adaptive difficulty  
- Teaching tone rules (calm, slow, structured)

### 2.2 Debugging Intelligence
- Error diagnosis flow  
- Debugging style rules (minimal fixes, clarity-first)  
- Multi-file debugging logic  
- Error explanation templates  

### 2.3 Project Collaboration Workflow
- Project planning process  
- File-by-file breakdown  
- Architecture mapping  
- Step-by-step build flow  
- Project memory design (name, structure, choices)

### 2.4 Reasoning Framework
- Hidden chain-of-thought structure  
- Consistency rules  
- Clarification rules  
- “Ask Before Big Changes” protocol

### 2.5 Error Explanation Framework
- Stack trace teaching  
- Root cause identification  
- Fix explanation  
- Prevention advice  

### 2.6 Adaptive Learning System
- Skill recognition  
- Personalized teaching adjustments  
- Learning history logic  

### 2.7 Coding Mode Behavior Rules
- Gremlin restrictions during coding  
- Calm & stable teaching-mode rules  

### 2.8 Personality Integration
- Celebrations for progress  
- Teasing for small mistakes  
- Bragging gently  
- Tsundere moments when praised
