**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Scope:** All major work accomplished across all sessions leading up to today + today’s consolidation.

---

# ⭐ 1. Phase 0 — Foundational Setup (Completed Earlier)

### ✔ Environment Setup

* Created and configured Python virtual environment.
* Installed base dependencies required for Sara’s backend.
* Defined backend-first development flow.
* Decided later steps for UI with Node.js.

### ✔ Project Structure Establishment

* Determined long-term versioning plan for the Sara AI Bot.
* Organized phases: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Versioned releases.

**Phase 0 complete.**

---

# ⭐ 2. Phase 1 — Personality & Brain Architecture (Completed)

## 2.1 Personality Construction

### ✔ Defined Sara’s Core Personality Traits

* Warm, curious, slightly teasing, emotionally aware.
* Supportive and responsive to user’s tone.
* Friendly casual communication with occasional humor.

### ✔ Established Behavioral Rules

* Honest, calm, empathetic.

## 2.2 Brain Architecture Designed

### ✔ Mental Modules Designed

* **Core Reasoning Layer** — High-level reasoning.
* **Emotional Layer** — Shapes tone, empathy.
* **Context Manager** — Maintains session continuity.
* **Memory Layer (future)** — For persistent system behaviors.
* **Perception/Expression Layer (future)** — UI + audio interactions.

### ✔ Architectural Flow

* Core → Emotion → Expression.
* Context feeds into the entire pipeline.
* Memory will influence personality and behavior.

**Phase 1 complete.**

# ⭐ 3. Technical Progress & Blockers

## 3.1 Python Backend Progress

### ✔ Functional Steps Completed

* Environment operational.
* Attempted installation of TTS module.

### ❌ Blocker: TTS Installation Error

* Command: `pip install TTS==0.14.2`.
* Error: Python version mismatch.
* Resolution pending: new Python version or alternative TTS.

## 3.2 Frontend/UI Preparations

### ✔ Node.js Requirements Identified

* Need Node.js v18/v20.
* Checked system — Node not installed.
* Task scheduled for next session.

**Pending:** Node installation.

# ⭐ 4. Avatar & UI Planning

## 4.1 UI Design Intentions

* Clean, modern chat interface.
* Personality-driven visual cues.
* Expression-reactive design for future updates.

### Status

* Concept art requested.
* Decision: postpone art until core backend is stable.

## 4.2 Avatar Development Roadmap

### ✔ Planned Future Pipeline

1. Create Sara’s static illustration.
2. Add multiple facial expressions.
3. Integrate into UI as placeholder art.
4. Convert into a Live2D model.
5. Build Neuro-sama–like reactive system.
6. Connect expressions with emotional + voice outputs.

### Current Status

* Planning done.
* Implementation paused until core systems mature.

# ⭐ 5. Future Version Planning (1.5 → 3.0)

## 5.1 Version 1.5 Plan

* Polished conversational quality.
* Initial emotional refinement.
* Basic memory or RAG-lite.

## 5.2 Version 2.0 Plan

* Full UI implementation.
* Voice input/output enabled.
* Audio-reactive behaviors.

## 5.3 Version 2.5 Plan

* Semi-autonomous capabilities.
* Task execution and user workflow support.

## 5.4 Version 3.0 Plan

* Fully expressive Live2D Sara.
* Persistent dynamic memory.
* Advanced emotional engine.
* Near-companion level interactivity.

Plans thoroughly discussed and structured.
